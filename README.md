# Projection

Simple `GLUT` app for projection mapping onto virtual 3D objects.

## Why

Frameworks were mucking up how the shaders should respond. This is getting in
the way of porting the code over the GLSL. Also, I felt like coding in GLUT.

## Build

This is being developed on MacOS X, but it should be *mostly* platform
independent. Building should be done from the command-line with the following,
or equivalent:

```
cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>
make
```
